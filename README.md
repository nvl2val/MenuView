# MenuView
This project will contains some custom menus.

I'm working on the first one: `QuadBubbleMenu`. 

### Intro:
QuadBubbleMenu is a quadrant menu whose item views' shape is circle.

### Next: 
+ Support to customize axis view's drawable
+ Remove `itemSpace` and change `minDistanceToAxisView` to `distanceToAxisView`
+ Support to set axis view's background using color in xml
